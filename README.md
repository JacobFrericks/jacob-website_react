# Personal Website
Hello! ðŸ‘‹ 

Welcome to the code behind my website! Here's a quick overview:
* The website is written in React, TypeScript, and SASS.
* The [components](https://github.com/JacobFrericks/jacob-website_react/tree/master/src/components) directory contains both SCSS style sheets and each component code
* The [images](https://github.com/JacobFrericks/jacob-website_react/tree/master/src/img) directory contains images found on the page.
* The [objects](https://github.com/JacobFrericks/jacob-website_react/tree/master/src/objects) directory contains TypeScript objects.
* The [projects](https://github.com/JacobFrericks/jacob-website_react/projects) page shows the current roadmap. If it's empty, then the website has been completed!
